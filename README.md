# DVH Prediction (from plan DIVOM to delivered DVH)
This project aimed to develop a tool for actual delivery DVH prediction

# DVH Prediction mainly use two approaches
1) PCA+SVR machine learning methods to predict the DVH curves
2) AutoDecoder + 1DCNN deep learning methods to predict DVH curves

# DVH aims also have two folds
1) To boost the generation of Monaco Template
2) To predict the actual delivered DVH directly
